	<h2>French Roast</h2>
	<br><br>
	<p>White smoke hangs down as the glistening beans turn ebony. This is French Roast, and you can't roast it darker. Straightforward, light-bodied with low acidity and immensely popular since 1971, our darkest roast is adored for its intense smokiness. Bring home rich, full flavor in every cup.</p>
