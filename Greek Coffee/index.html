  <h4>Laura Winslow</h4>
  <p>In the coffee shop we are as awkward lovers, pretending to be there of convenience, afraid of our need to connect to one another. This place filled with people always so close and so far apart... this is the community of our era... as close as we can be without admitting the truth.</p>
  <h4>Steve Jobs</h4> 
  <p>It's early and the machines are yet to warm, so I ponder this chance to rest a moment longer, to drink in the aroma of this place. The barista has tired eyes, yet there is that glimmer, a give away of her good heart. She's one of those surviving sparks, one of the ones who held on to who they really are. I ask for my danish to be warmed, apologizing amid my own tired smile, "Sorry, I'm just feeling like being a bit of a fuss pot today."
  I see her spark glow a little brighter, her face more relaxed, a smidge more joy in her eyes, "That's alright, dear, you be a fuss pot."
  I laugh unexpectedly, and I know that I'm feeling that tiny bit better too, "Thanks for indulging my fuss-pot-ism. I needed that."</p>
  <h4>Jason Wittz<h4>
  <p>In the cafe we sit, my friend and I, helping each other find ways to make our lives and loves better. We are each other's best doctor and medicine combined. The coffee, the music and the smile of someone who cares, it's a fragment of heaven, a chance to enjoy company and to start to want more.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Greek Cafe! We are a new establishment started January 1, 2020. We’re not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else that goes with a full and rewarding coffeehouse experience. We also offer a selection of premium teas, fine pastries and other delectable treats to please the taste buds. And the music you hear in store is chosen for its artistry and appeal.

It’s not unusual to see people coming to Greek Cafe to chat, meet up or even work. We’re a neighborhood gathering place, a part of the daily routine – and we couldn’t be happier about it. Get to know us and you’ll see: we are so much more than what we brew.

We make sure everything we do is through the lens of humanity – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly. At the heart of our business, we seek to inspire and nurture the human spirit - understanding that each person brings a distinct life experience to the table. Our partners are diverse not only in gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, religion and age, but also in cultural backgrounds, life experiences, thoughts and ideas.

Embracing diversity only enhances our work culture, it also drives our business success. It is the inclusion of these diverse experiences and perspectives that create a culture of empowerment, one that fosters innovation, economic growth and new ideas.</p>
