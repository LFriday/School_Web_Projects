	<h2>Kenya African Blend</h2>
	<br><br>
	<p>Rising above vast deserts, grassy plains and ancient lava flows, the mountains of Kenya are renowned for growing some of the worldâ€™s most prized coffees. For this refined blend, we started with coffee from Kenya and then coaxed out its bright sweetness with balanced East African beans. Every intriguing sip reveals hints of tropical fruit and brown sugar. Suggested food pairing: Grapefruit, Berry Cobbler, Muffins.</p>
